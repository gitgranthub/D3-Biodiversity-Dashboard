# D3-Biodiversity-Dashboard
An interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, 
which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. 
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species
(also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present
in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
